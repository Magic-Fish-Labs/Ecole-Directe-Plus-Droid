## Contributing 🖇️

Contributions are always welcome!

To contribute to this discord.JS project, start by cloning this repo on your computer by following these steps:

- Clone the repo on your local machine

    > ```git clone https://github.com/Magic-Fishes/Ecole-Directe-Plus-Droid ```

- Run these commands
    > ``` cd Ecole-Directe-Plus-Droid```

Now go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new app, go to the "Bot" section and click on "Reset Token" to get your token, copy it and **do not share it with anyone, it's PRIVATE!**

Now go back to your CLONE, go into the `.env` file, normally you will find a key named `TOKEN`, after `=`, paste your private discord bot token.

We're almost there...

Still in `.env`, paste these lines next to your `TOKEN`

```SOCKET_URL=wss://ecole-directe.plus/ws:7890
GROQ_API_KEY=<YOUR GROQ API KEY>
NODE_ENV=developpment
MAIN_SERVER_ID=<YOUR SERVER ID>
```


Complete your Groq API key in the `GROQ_API_KEY`.

To get your server ID, start by activating developer mode on your account by [following this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/)
After that, go to your server, right-click on the top banner with your server name, and click "Copy Server ID" with the `ID` icon.

Paste it in the `MAIN_SERVER_ID` in your `.env`

Congrats  🎉 🎉 🎉

You can start editing files and run your bot by executing this in your project folder `npm run dev`!
